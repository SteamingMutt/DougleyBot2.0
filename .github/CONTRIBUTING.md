**Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the development of WildBeast!**

Please follow these rules when making contributions to this repository.

# Source code

## Unwanted contributions

1. Changes to ESLint configuration without justifiable reason
2. New commands that are confusing to use for end users
3. Breaking changes to already existing commands, unless strictly necessary
4. Unnecessarily large restructurings of code

## Code rules

### Verified as working

All code contributed to this repository should be verified as working, meaning you've tested the functionality at least once and didn't encounter unexpected behaviour.  
Please keep in mind that we might ask you to confirm if this is the case.

### ESLint

ESLint handles our style enforcement, when making contributions, **please confirm your code adheres to the style**, your build will fail otherwise and we're less inclined to merge it.  
To verify your code adheres to our styleguide, run `npm test` in the project root.

## Code practices

### Translations

All user-facing text, meaning text that gets send to Discord and is displayed to end-users, needs to be included in the i18n framework.  
The framework utilises ICU syntax for translations, a primer for this syntax can be found [here](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax).

```js
// âœ— bad
context.editOrRespond(`Hi there ${user.name}!`);
```

```js
// âœ“ good
context.editOrRespond(i18n.t("user.greeting", { name: user.name }));
```

### Database operations

We use Knex as our SQL driver, and we write abstractions in the form of drivers for each moving part that requires database access.  
When something requires database access and does not already have a driver, **do not directly import Knex, make a driver instead**  
When writing Knex abstractions, your abstractions should provide support for the databases we support officially, namely SQLite and PostgreSQL

### Promises and async

**Always** chain promises where possible.

```js
// âœ— bad
aPromise()
  .then((result) => {
    anotherPromise(result)
      .then((anotherresult) => {
        console.log(anotherresult);
      })
      .catch(console.error);
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

```js
// âœ“ good
aPromise()
  .then((result) => {
    return anotherPromise(result);
  })
  .then((anotherresult) => {
    console.log(anotherresult);
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

```js
// âœ“ even better
aPromise()
  .then(async (result) => {
    const anotherresult = await anotherPromise(result);
    console.log(anotherresult);
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

```js
// ðŸ’¯ great!
(async () => {
  // top-level async is used as an example, its not required
  try {
    const result = await aPromise();
    const anotherresult = await anotherPromise(result);
    console.log(anotherresult);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
})();
```

## Commands

### Sorting

Commands are sorted first by type, then by base command if the command has subcommands, and then by subcommand.
If your command doesn't have subcommands or your command is a context menu action, placing the entire command in 1 file is fine.

### Inheritance

All commands must extend a base class. Do **NOT** make new instances the base class, but export the resulting class.

```ts
// âœ— bad
export default new BaseSlashCommand({
  // ...
});
```

```ts
// âœ“ good
export default class GreetCommand extends BaseSlashCommand {
  // ...
}
```
